/*
The Cell class models each individual cell of the game board. Cell has an
instance variable called content (with package access), of the type enum
Player. You can only assign a value from the enum constants into the Cell
content. The constant assigned to the Cell, if it is a Nought or a Cross, is
drawn in its paint()method (which gets called by the Board class). A Cell
also has an operation calledclear().
